# Data

This Data Set has been taken from Kaggle.com and originally included 21 features whic have now beem reduced to 9.
    
### Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, **Outcome**. 

Predictor variables includes:

    1. Pregnancies
    2. BMI
    3. Insulin Level
    4. Age
    5. Blood Pressure 
    6. Skin Thickness 
    7. Diabetes Pedigree Function

### Learning Objective
The main purpose of this project was to implement the theoretical knowledge gained during my ML trainings. The other goal was to learn Flask and its implementation including gathering knowledge about flask routes,syntax etc. Thorough this project I gained valuable insights and in-depth knowledge about implementation of:

- Data gathering 
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling 
- Model Evaluation
- Stacking
- Pickling


### Technologies Used  

- Pyhton
- pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Pickle
